# involution-index
An sociological index invented by myself, representing the pressure students have to bear in a specific country/region.

INVI (Involution Index) = (UMC line (Upper middle class control line) - LMC line (Lower middle class control line)) * EduRate (Ratio of education expenditure to household expenditure) * Gini (Gini coefficient) * HDI (Human Development Index) / GNI per capita (Per capita income)

Regions with a value less than 0.5 have basically no education pressure - low

Regions with a value more than 0.5 starts to have greater education pressure - medium

Regions with a value more than 1.0 starts to have extreme education pressure, also known as "involute" - high

Regions with a value more than 5.0 starts to have ultra-extreme education pressure, entering "hell mode" - very high
